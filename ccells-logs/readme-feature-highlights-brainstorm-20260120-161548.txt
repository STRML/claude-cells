# Title: README feature highlights brainstorm

# Prompt: are there any other features of ccells you'd wnat to highlight in the readme? can we market it up a bit?

============================================================

  - Helpful introduction dialog for new users
  "Run multiple Claude Code instances in parallel..."
  More punchy alternatives:
  - "Claude Code, parallelized. Ship multiple features simultaneously without context switching."
  - "Set it and forget it. Let Claude work autonomously while you focus on other workstreams."
  Feature badges/highlights for top of README:

  1. Isolation - the foundation of everything else
  2. No permission dialogs - because isolation = safety = autonomy
  3. No git conflicts - worktrees mean no .git/index.lock wars
  4. Pure Claude Code TUI - no wrapper UI, just multiplied panes
  5. Devcontainer support - works with your existing setup

  The "no custom UI" angle is actually undersold. The README touches on it in the quote block, but it's a major di
fferentiator. Most multi-agent tools bury the AI behind their own interface. ccells is basically "tmux for Claude
Code" - it gets out of the way.

  Sharper positioning:
  - "A terminal multiplexer, not a framework"
  - "We don't wrap Claude Code, we tile it"
  - "Your machine is the only limit"

  Key callouts to add:
  - Devcontainer support (missing entirely)
  - Emphasize the "set it and forget it" autonomy angle
  - Remove the "12 workstream" limit from Limitations section (or say "limited only by your hardware")

  Want me to draft updated copy for the README with these angles?
